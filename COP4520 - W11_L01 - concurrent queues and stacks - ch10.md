#### FIve fold path
1. coarse grain locking
2. fine grained locking
3. optimistic synchronization
4. lazy synchronization
5. lock-free synchronization

Queues are total order FIFO, Stacks are total order LIFO

Pools are new data structure, can either be bounded or unbounded memory

Non-blocking case might be QUEUE which throws exception instead of blocking upon dequeue on empty queue
