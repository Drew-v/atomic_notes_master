[great explanation from quora here](https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-explain-partial-order-and-total-order-in-simple-terms) 

an order is a way of telling when something is smaller than something else. for example, given some integers, we can use operators like $\leq$  to compare them. these integers have a ***total order*** because, given two numbers, one is always less than or equal to another. 

a ***partial order*** is an order where this is not the case. sometimes we cant compare two items at alll: they're not eqial. smaller or larger than eachother. take books as an example. there are multiple dimensions which make direct/simplistic comparisons difficult or impossible.
