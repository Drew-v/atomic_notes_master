dynamic load balancing, useful for hard to predict workloads

static vs dynamic, static is determined at compile time(hardcoded) vs dynamic is determined at runtime. 

atomic operations: read/write value, increment value, some others which may be considered atomic and uninteruptable depending on cpu and its architecture. these operations are safe in a multithreaded environment 

for example, in java, writing value++; gets decomposed into several atomic steps before execuition. which can be interupted by other threads.

the synchronization of threads cant be guaranteed (ie one may read a shared resource and write after another thread completed a read/write already) which can cause serious bugs. For example, this could result in differant returned value for each run when should be identical. 

the likelihood of a thread having overlap issues go up by n! where n is the number of threads. 

__When writing code mfor multiple threads, must make each operation for shared resource atomic. Operations can only work on the size of a memory word, often 64 bits. __

java synchronize block locks down the resource while it is being used, which doesnt perform quickly(formula 1 car using breaks analogy)

## Mutual exclusion, resource locks
exlcusive resource usage for threads

__two types of formal properties in asynchronous compution:__
- safety properties
	- nothing bad happens ever
- liveness properties
	- something good happens eventually

a thread must do more to ensure resource is not being used than just observing it, otherwise another cpu could access it in the time it takes former to perform a write action since the observation

deadlock is a common issue with concurrent programming, and can be latent in nature

having threads be deferential to certain other threads can resolve this issue (__slide 55__)
