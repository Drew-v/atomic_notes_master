Multilayer perceptron 

Designed to overcome the single perceptron limitation of linear data uses only. Multilayer can tackle non-linear data. **it is a neural network where the mapping between inputs and output is non-linear.** It has input and output layers, and one or more hidden layers, with many neurons stacked together. While in the perceptron the neuron must have an activation functions, either [[sigmoid function]] or [[RelU function]], **neurons in multilayer perceptron can use any arbitrary activation function. **. 

Multilayer perceptron uses a  [[feedforward algorithm| feedforward mechanism]] and [[backpropagation|backpropagation mechanism]] as steps in its learning process. It seems that feedforward algorithm is the estimation, and backpropigation is like the cost function, which enables the network to learn and adjust weights.
