# What is machine learning?
It is the science and art of programming computers so they can learn from data. More generally the field of study giving computers the ability to learn without explicit programming.
Machine Learning programmers must explore and pre process data to feed ML algorithms. This is done using [[data science]] methods
- **Use machine learning if:**
	- Problem w/ existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules
	- Complex problems where traditional approaches provide no good solution
	- Fluctuating environment, ML system adapts to new data
	- Gain insights about complex problems and large amounts of data
### Types of ML systems: 
1. [[supervised machine learning]] and  [[unsupervised machine learning]] types:
	- [[supervised machine learning | supervised]]
	- [[unsupervised machine learning|unsupervised]]
	- [[semisupervised machine learning|semisupervised]]
2. [[reinforcement learning]]
3. [[online machine learning]] and [[Offline batch learning]]
4. [[Model based learning ]]vs [[instance based learning]]

### The machine learning pipeline:
[[data exploration]] -> [[data preprocessing]] -> [[model selection]] -> [[hyperparameter tuning]]
1. Is machine learning the right tool for the job?
2. Aquire data, if third party may be good to understand where it came from
3. Discover and visualize data
4. prepare data to train relevant machine learning algorithms
5. model selection: test many, choose best one
6. Hyper param tuning
7. Present solution
8. Launch monitor and maintain your system

### What are the pitfalls, that lead to poor performance?
- **[[Machine learning - when data goes wrong]]**

- **[[Machine learning - when the model goes wrong]]**


### How is information encoded to feed machine learning algorithms?
- [[one-hot encoding]]
- [[Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency]] (TF-IDF)

### [[activation function]]
