These notes will be based on Gerber's lectures and notes. 

Gerb: respect this course, dont fall behind or you will be squished. The hardest stuff will be in second half of the course.

Take home exams are open book open notes, 24 hours to take exams from release date.

Discord: helping other students should be limited to discussing concepts used in question but not specifics

## Now for the Mathy stuff:
Integers, rational numbers are discrete. Real numbers are NOT discrete. 

Discrete mathematics is how we reason with rational and integer numbers. 

Problem solving process will be learning the cause, the effect, the reason. This class will teach the fundamental patterns of all compution. We will also learn which questions can be solved computionationally with a computer. I.E. is it exponential and does n = 1000? Solution will never be reached. 

## Questions and concepts this course will cover
[[Finite automata]], paired with the concept of [[regular language]]

[[push down automata]], and their related [[context free languages]]

what does [[turing complete]] mean?

[[decidability]] and [[reducibility]]

[[complexity]], Noam Chomsky's hierarchy of languages

Fundamental techniques for working with formal languages 

The most common classes of problems that are and are not computable. Example the halting problem 

The common classes of problems that are and are not tractable. N^1000 compute time.

What the P, NP and NP-Complete classes are and how they do and do not relate to computability and tractability. 

## this course requires the textbook!
Sipser, _Introduction to the Theory of Computation_ (3rd Edition, 2013).  Cengage.  ISBN 978-1133187790.  Errata at [http://math.mit.edu/~sipser/itoc-derrs3.1.html](http://math.mit.edu/~sipser/itoc-derrs3.1.html). Link is for corrections to the textbook.

Chapter 0 has quick references to all the hard shit from discrete 1! Yay. Gerb says this is one of the best textbooks he has ever read covering topics in computer science. 

Will be a lot of work to do with counting from discrete 1.
