### Linear bounded Automata
your computer is a linear bounded automata

technically we can decide the properties of a memory bounded automata, however with this in mind lets determine the possibble memory combinaytions pf the atari 2600 from the 1970s. It had 128 Bytes of memory. one byte has 256 possible combinations, so then we take $256^{128}$ which is a number so infinitely huge, it may be more than the number of atoms in the observable universe....

even the simplest physical computer systems are absolutely impractical to fully simulate, therefore we cannot decide turing machine properties, except for the absolute simplest turing machine computing systems, which we need to simulate every possible state of the turing machine (linear bound automata)

turing machine configurations can be simulated with the dominos,

ability to simulate the configurations of turing machiens. we can say undecidability is unsolvable, because if it is, we could shove it into PCP and decide it.

***BIG NOTE: THE WWAY WE ENCODE THE DOMINOS IS WHAT GETS US THE ANSWERS TO THE PCP QUESTIONS IN THE HOMEWORK***
LOOK AT THE SLIDES FOR PCP IN THE POWERPOINTS.... he didnt go over the exaact mechanics opf pcp. prof said we need to understand the generalities of how it works to apply to the homework.

pick this lecture back up at complexity! tiime is at 20 minutes, i think its the march 21rst lecture...
