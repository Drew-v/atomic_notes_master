GNFA: generalied non-deterministic finite automata, it is a regular dfa that uses regular expression to transfer between states. 

order does not matter in terms of equivalency between regular expressions when ripping out states and repairing (translating) them to reg ex

this process is described in t=detail in slide 26 of reg expressions slide deck.

working through example at 38:00 feb 8th lecture, turning DFA into GNFA using table and (R_ar)(R_r)(R_rb)(R_ab)

prof says this method is over complicated, not to use it in practise.
