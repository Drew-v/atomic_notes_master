Z is all ints 0 to infinity

### sets
powerset is a binary matrix, a list of all binary possibuilities taking each possibiklity of the underlying set.
total elems in power set is 2^n where n is num of elems in base set

__HOW TO PROVE SOMETHING__
	- start writing, dont get stalled. Put pen to paper
1. understand statement
2. convince yourself if it is true or false
3. work out its impolications to get general sense of _why_ it is true or false
4. break down any subcases
5. get started

__quasi narrative format and two-column format to solve proofs__
	- will be using this a lot, make sure to understand it
- proofs by direct arguement
	- narrative/two column format i think
- construction
	- will be used a lot
- contradiction
	- the evil chicken!
- weak induction
	- division algorithm proof, euclid's theorem proof
- strong induction
