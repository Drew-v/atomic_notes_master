## Our last lecture :(

### Interviews preparation
- Have projects or certifications to talk about in an interview. Talk about how these projects could be commercially applicable, how is predicting esrb ratings useful? Maybe for marketing concerns.
- These Machine learning projects must be involved and from real world datasets
- Maybe get carts from DataCamp! Prof said excel proficiency is important. Finish the machine learning certification
### tribal knowledge 
- HR people write job descriptions, based on what hiring manager needs. This means they might not exactly reflect needs of mamager, (HR are non technical)
	- So apply anyways with this in mind, if you feel under qualified 
	- If not experienced enough, they might hire you at a lower pay grade than advertised position
- Looks bad if switching employment every year. 3-5 years is standard, before moving up/getting a promotion
- When evaluating an offer, check local job market to compare against the market, if remote, company will offer based on your current cost of living for your area
- When interviewing, asking for a 5% negotiable increase is reasonable. Beyond that is risking them rejecting offer, finding someone else. 
- Federal jobs are good to retire from (after 20 years), next move is to work in industry for crazy money, as someone with inside knowledge with companies who do business with the government. 
	- This applies especially to security branches of gov, example, nsa, fbi, geospatial inteligence agency, etc. also nasa?
### security clearance stuff
- excessive drug use matters if illegal at federal level
	- If smoked couple years ago, doesn't matter
	- Regular use is a different issue
- they will need 3 non familial references
- It matters if you are in close contact with foreign nationals, especially if they are from hostile countries.
- Also matters if you have traveled to foreign countries, especially if to hostile countries 

### resources for machine learning, further studying, what next?
- [https://paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/): this is great for reading machine learning papers with their code
- BOOK: Reinforcement learning with Andrew barto, 2nd edition(2020)
- Bayesian statistics very useful for ml, also understand types of data distributions, linear algebra 
- Gym-open air.com for reinforcement learning fun 
## studying tips
- Write out math formulas with specific numbers to walk through them, some of it is simpler than it appears
- Real world optimization problems use lots of differential mathematics
- MIT opencourseware: math course on matrix methods and data analytics
- Abstract algebra an interesting course topic, "class makes sense of all the math courses taken, algebra/calc/diffEQ etc."
