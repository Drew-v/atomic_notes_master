**Overfitting** happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount and nosiness of the training data. Solutions include:
	- simplify your model, select fewer parameters (linear vs nth degree), by reducing number of attributes in training data OR constrain the model. 
	- gather more training data. 
	- Reduce noise in training data, eg:
		- Fix data errors
		- remove outliers

Shows unbalanced training data, which has been overfitted by a high order polynomial model. Will generalize very poorly to new data.
