A relation R on a set X is a subset of $X \times Y$ . If $(a, b) \in R$ , we write xRy. 
In other words, x is related to y. 

for example: xGy: x is greater than y. 
(4,3): G(4,3) is true
(2,3): G(2,3) is false

***reflexive***: $\forall x, xRx$. For example, the '=' relation, it is reflexive: xRx. $4\in x$  $(4,4)\in R=>4=4$

***symmetric***: $\forall x \forall y, xRy=>yRx$. Take the $\neq$ relation. it is symmetric, $4 \neq 3 => 3 \neq 4$ 
																			      							 $xRy => yRx$ 
***transitive***: $\forall x \forall y \forall z => xRz$. a good example is the $<$ relation. $1 < 2 < 3 => 1 < 3$ 

**Note:** these relationship properties are used to describe relationships. They are not used to enforce rules on relationships. It must be shown to be true??? proof by contradiction is very useful to prove these relationship properties. 

**ExamplesÂ of reflexive relations include:**

-   "is equal to" ([equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics) "Equality (mathematics)"))
-   "is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of" (set inclusion)
-   "divides" ([divisibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor "Divisor"))
-   "is greater than or equal to"
-   "is less than or equal to"

**Examples of irreflexive relations include:**

-   "is not equal to"
-   "is [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime "Coprime") to" (for the integers {\displaystyle >1,}![{\displaystyle >1,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/591741717a2e633f56e804b79ec26d67e1a5367e) since 1 is coprime to itself)
-   "is a proper subset of"
-   "is greater than"
-   "is less than"
