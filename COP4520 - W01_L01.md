important terms
- parallel programming
	- shared programming? aka concurrency: figures out how to synchronize threads so that different threads dont mess up eachothers workflow
- distributed programming: how to divide problem into smaller pieces to be computed in different locations over a network. 

Real world scaling process: decreaing returns with higher core counts, due to issues of resource sharing 

### concurrent processing:
share resources amung multiple threads while minimizing performance loss

__load balancing__: make sure each processor has equivalent share of work, easier to fin dprimes of small numbers, and there is lower prime density the higher up you go

__known 'seeds' for testing prime numbers to reduce the total numbers which need to be tested__
homework will be to split primes problem space evenly
