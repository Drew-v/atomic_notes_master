1. How would you define machine learning?
	Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence which relies on statistical methods to make connections on training data, to generalize to unseen data making predictions.
2. Name fourn types of problems where machine learning shines.
	image pattern recognition, speech recognition, dimensionality reduction for simulations(better performance similar accuracy), game agent optimization (video game AI)
3. What is a lebeled training set?
	Data set where target values are known and defined for each training sample. Used as input for supervised machine learning algorithms
4. What are the two most common supervised learning tasks?
?????
5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
???
6. What type of ML algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
	A batch (offline) unsupervised algorithm, or perhaps a reinforcement learning algorithm
7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
????
8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or unsupervised learning problem?
	Supervised, because training data is already labeled by users as spam. Rhys
