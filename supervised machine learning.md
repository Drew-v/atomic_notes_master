In supervised machine learning, the training set data includes desired solutions, called labels. Some big hitting supervised algorithms include:
- [[k-nearest neighbors]]
- [[Linear Regression]]
- [[Logistic Regression]]
- [[Support Vector Machines]]
- [[Decision Trees and Random Forests]]
- [[Neural Networks]]
- [[softmax regression]]
