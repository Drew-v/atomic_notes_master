 **The objective of the convolution layer is to extract the high level features such as edges, from input image** Convolution layers are used in [[convolutional neural networks]].
- stride length regulates kernal/filter shifting (indexing) over the image
- in every shift, a matrix multiplication is performed between K and the portion P of image which kernal is overlapping

In this case, image being traversed is in RGB (greyscale would be one layer), and so has a depth of 3 layers. The filter shifts to the right until reach end, moves down one level and continues right shifting.  The outer row/column of filter extends 1 past the image edges.

- For a 5x5 image and a 3x3 filter, output would be a scalar value for each shift, and an end result of a 4x4 matrix 
- If multiple layers deep, scalar value of each layer is combined to single value for output matrix
- Results of matrix mult. are summed if multiple layers, and a bias is added
- **this operation gives us a squashed one depth convoluted feature output**

Conventionally, the first conv layer detects low level features; edges, color or gradient orientation. Adding more conv layers enables higher level features to be detected. A kernal can either increase, decrease, or keep dimensionality of input image the same. Depending on stride, valid padding may ignore some pixels at the bottom and right of the input image. 
- **Same Padding**: 5x5x1 image  -> 6x6x1 image and apply 3x3x1 kernal, the coonvolved matrix is 5x5x1, same as input image
- **Valid Padding:** without padding, resultant convolved matrix is 3x3x1, size of kernal itself
