Often labeling data is expensive, limited resources make algorithms which can guess labels of training data instances based on inferences from labeled data. Most of these algorithms are combinations of supervised and unsupervised algorithms. 

For example, the semisupervised algorithm [[deep belief networks]] [DBNs] are based on unsupervised components
