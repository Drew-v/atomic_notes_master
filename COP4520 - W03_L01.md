cache coherent protocol and compiler can reorder or change order of code lines in an attempt to optimize program without changing it funcamentally. this can sometimes cause issues. this can interfere with the producer-consumer model (context it was taught)

this is not a problem with normal sequential oprogramming, but becomes a problem when doing concurrent programming

read chapter 3 several times. 

use slide 9 to make queue of primes for assignment 1. correctness guaranteed, performance wont be optimized 

step throguh program, if there seems to be a concurrency issue, imagine a sequential program, if they will fail any differently or not

main thread is separate from solution theads for the assignment 1
