**Data science** the uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights. 

[[data visualization]] tools useful for machine learning:
- **[[t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)]]**
	- unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction 
	- ** considered more effective than [[Principal component analysis (PCA)| PCA]]**
	- Preserve local structure of data by minimizing the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]] between the two distributions WRT locations of points inn the map
- **[[Principal component analysis (PCA)]]**
	- Unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction/visualization of data
	- Transform, combining highly correlated features to a new vector set known as [[Principal component]]
