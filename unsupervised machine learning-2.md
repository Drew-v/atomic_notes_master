In unsupervised machine learning, training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher. Some of the most important unsupervised algorithms include:
- [[Clustering]]
	- [[K-Means]]
	- [[DBSCAN]]
	- [[Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA)]]
- [[Anomaly detection and novelty detection]]
	- [[One-Class SVM]]
	- [[Isolation Forest]]
- [[Visualization and dimensionality reduction]]
	- [[Principal Compnent ANanlysis]]
	- [[Kernal PCA]]
	- [[Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)]]
	- [[t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)]]
- [[Association rule learning]]
	- [[Apriori]]
	- [[Eclat]]
