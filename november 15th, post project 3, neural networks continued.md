Ensemble networks, taking =average of multiple networks and feeding to a meta network for final output prediction

Sigmoid effective with shallow networks, vanishing gradient problem occur with deeper networks, where RelU becomes more effective

Learning rate, optimizing starting weights, etc have impact on resulting performance of model

.005 learning rate, on small size

Early stopping, try not to use on initial runs 

Standardization if data doesn't follow normal distribution?

Want to rescale data if features on are much different scale

**these should be taken into account for the exploratory data analysis**

All dense layers, self function

On complex project, start stupid, see what works, see how it works, add complexity



Read chapter (look at chapters 10-13) BUT ESPECIALLY read 14 before starting assignment 4! Only 4 submissions per day

Tensorflow tutorials for beginner, and for image classification 

Kara's image transformations very useful

## Conolutional neural network mini lecture
take advantage of model summary command

CNNs use convolutions to minimize the total weight values (parameters), to allow for larger networks

Insight on visualizing out put of individual layers (activation output) in a CNN
