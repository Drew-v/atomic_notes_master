__Computer security defined: protection system to protect C.I.A. of data__
- confidentiality of data
	- privacy
- integrity
	- dont get modified maliciously 
- availihbility 
	- works promptly and for thsoe users who are authorized 

## Achieve confidentiality
- encryption 
- access control
- authentication
- authorization
- physical security 
### Achieve Integrity 
- backups
- Checksums
- Data correcting codes
### Achieve Availabilty
- physical protections
- computional redundancies 
	- different locations/backup disk images
### Achieve Digital Security 
- authenticate 
	- verify user, server communication
- accountability 
	- log activity to users whose identity can be proven/known
### Computer Security Challenges
- atacker find one weakness, develoiper must anticipate all weaknesses 
- users/managers dont see security benefits until failure occurs
- security often an add on after system is fully designed
- often considered an impediment to user friendliness

### What can be considered Assets?
- hardware
- software/operating systems
- data
- communication facilities/networks\
### what are threats?
- vulnerabilities 
	- corrupted
	- leaky
	- unavailable/slow
- Threat
	- something/someone capable of exploiting a vulnerability 
	- represents a potential security harm to a system 
### attack types
- active
	- attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation
- passive
	- steal information on system but no alteration
- indide attack
- outside attack
### coountermeasures
prevent, detect and recover from an attack
- counter measures can themselves introduce vulnerabilities 
### Security Functional Requirements
- perfect security not possible, so system can be built in a way to minimize damage of security breach
- design disaster/contingency plans 
## Fundamental Design Principals
- open design, tested in the wild 
- least privledge
- isolation
- plus more, slide 23 lecture 2
## Attack Surfaces
- network attack surfaces
- software attack surfaces
- human attack surfaces
### Attack Trees: 
a hierarchical data structure to represents steps an attacker could take to achieve a particular security breach

## Computer Security Strategy
- security poolicy 
- security implementation
- assurance
- evaluation
