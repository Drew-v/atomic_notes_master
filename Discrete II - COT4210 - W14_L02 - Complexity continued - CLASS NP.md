#### 5 things i learned 
- framing conflict resolution: this is different with romantic partners, how to resolve conflict? must approach this from perspective of lifelong timeframe. if both people are not feeling ok or either one or other, than maybe it should be assumed to require resolution fittin gto the timeframe. cant bury it, cant ignore it with sexy times... ect
- Godel's incompleteness theorems, which are interprited to show that a consistent and complete set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible
	- another words, not every mathematical theorem can be proved or known

#### The class NP
if we have a polynomial time verifier we can make a non-deterministic decider. if we can have a non-deterministic decider, we can make a verifier. that means there is a non-deterministic deciderd IFF there is a verifier. 

therefore: the class of languages with deterministic polynomial time verifiers is equivalent to the class of languages decidable by nondeterministic polynomial time turing machines. 

**what is the class NP??**
it is all languages which have polynomials time verifiers. it is robust across computational models in the same way class P is. 

### P and NP
we do not know if NP $\subseteq$   P. Our best guess is that NP does not equal P and that NP is not subset to P. 

we will be learning NP reductions next week.
